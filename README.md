# Algorithms
This repository implements various algorithms written in Python to solve "Analysis and Development of Algorithm" discipline problems

### File discription:
- Algorithms_1 - Experimental study of the time complexity of different algorithms
- Algorithms_2 - The use of direct methods (one-dimensional methods of exhaustive search, dichotomy, golden
section search; multidimensional methods of exhaustive search, Gauss (coordinate descent),
Nelder-Mead) in the tasks of unconstrained nonlinear optimization
- Algorithms_3 - The use of first- and second-order methods (Gradient Descent, Non-linear Conjugate Gradient
Descent, Newtonâ€™s method and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) in the tasks of unconstrained
nonlinear optimization
- Algorithms_4 - The use of stochastic and metaheuristic algorithms (Simulated Annealing, Differential Evolution,
Particle Swarm Optimization) in the tasks of unconstrained nonlinear optimization and the
experimental comparison of them with Nelder-Mead and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms
- Algorithms_5 - The use of different representations of graphs and basic algorithms on graphs (Depth-first search
and Breadth-first search)
- Algorithms_6 - The use of path search algorithms on weighted graphs (Dijkstra's, A* and Bellman-Ford
algorithms)
